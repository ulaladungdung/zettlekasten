5. Join organization bug ==> cannot join org
6. add feedback on the way
7. On impact report, the mentor should see everyone's data, Now it only shows the mentor's personal data. (on organization, it shows the correct one)

8. Spider graph: compare freq of ss / no. of reflection of datapoints

For personal, call it skills insight instead of impact report.

Why have the visual arts presented a harder problem for stylometry than text has?

We are not able to count the frequency of some discrete entities in visual arts unlike how we are able to count the frequency of a word in a corpus in textual data.
However, like how we can differentiate authors in a body of text, we are also to the same "stylelometry" with visual arts, although more difficult. 
One of the example discussed is to use wavelet analysis.
