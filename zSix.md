## DBA
1. Show profile of decentralise and centralise purchases (i.e. Small value purchases, 3 quotes, ITQ and ITT, Limited ITQ/ITT, WOC) ==> Done
2.	Internal Customer satisfaction based on the feedback ==> Award Recommendation Purchase Experience
	1.	  Q1 rate the users' level of knowledge
	2.	 Q2 Rate the engagement time
	3.	 Q3 Response time
	4.	 Q4 How easy to comply
	5.	 Q5 not needed (anything else question)
3.	How many ITQ/ITT comes with at least 3 responses and 0 response ==> RTP/RFQ ==> **ask through email**
4.	EPV vs APV (Track Reliability of Estimation) ==> (RTP, Award Recommendation, Award Recommendation Base Items, Award Recommendation Option Items)
5.	No. of urgent purchases (Need by date shorter than prescribed timeline) ==> we saw this data before

1.	Procurement Staff Workload: Number of RFQs (i.e. ITT and ITQ) handled by each  Procurement staff ==> RTP/RFQ per staff name
2.	Average turnaround time to complete ITQ and ITT (based on each stage of Procurement, e.g. Average time to approve the Award  Recommendation, from time of receipt of Award Recommendation)) ==> check all the award recommendation stuff ==> 
3.	Late payments (should take into account the date that users complete the GR) ==> GR *pending*
4.	No. of PO closure not done in timely manner and unused PO funds not release for other use ==> PO pending

**questions**:
1. Where can we see the tendors' information for ITQ and ITT?
2. What is the difference between Award Recommendation base item vs option item?
3. For EPV vs APV, we only have 2 matching Id, we would generate some artificial data for the purpose of the visualization
4. May we know why the *created datetime* of award recommendation is later than its *created on and offer received datetime* ?
