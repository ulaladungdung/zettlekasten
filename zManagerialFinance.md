## Financial Statements
Report about an organization's financial result, financial condition, and cash flows.

statements:
1. Liquidity -> the ability to generate cash to p
2. Solvency -> whether a business has the capability to pay back its debts


3 main things:
1. Income statement -> profits (reflects financial performance)
2. Cash Flow Statement -> inflow - outflow (reflects liquidity and solvency)
3. Balance sheets -> equity = assets - liabilities (summarize financial position)

### Income statement
Usually per year/ quarter
**Gross profit** -> Revenue - (marginal) Cost of Goods Sold 
**Gross Margin** -> Gross Profit / Revenue
**EBIT** = operating profit( earnings before interests and taxes)
**EBIT Margin** -> EBIT/Revenue

#### Cost Of Goods Sold: Depreciation
*Instead* of including the full price of a fixed assets under **operating expenses** its costs is spread over the years it will be used and recorded as **depreciation**

e.g. A machine that costs $1m will not be counted as expenses. We then use **Straight Line Depreciation** for year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). 1 machine for 3 years. **So**, each year will have depreciation of $250,000 each year. After that the assets would have fully depreciated.

#### Operating Expense
Costs that are not directly related to the production and storage of a cmopany's goods

e.g. sales and marketing costs, administrative salaries, RnD expenses.

Difference with COGS, without OE production should still works. And this does not count in into the cost of goods.

### Cash FLow Statement
Everything that changes the amount in the bank

### Balance Sheet
Assets = Liabilities + owners Equity

### Net working Capital
Difference between assets and liabilities. Huge positive WC means that the company has larger current assets than its current liabilities.

**Negative** working capital can happen when the company take cash upfront and pay suppliers later like how Dell has been doing it for years.

### Profitability ratios
1. Return on Assets. (income / total assets)
2. Return on Equity (net income / total equity)

## Use case
 - positive account payable is like a cash inflow. *For example* when you buy 100 books from a supplier and the invoice is due in 1 year. Having sold the book by the first month, you do not have to payoff the suppliers. You can use the cash for more sales or other money generating stuff before paying off the supplier
 - High revenue with lower earnings, => the company may not be able to turn the sales captured into money
 - borrow money increases ROE
