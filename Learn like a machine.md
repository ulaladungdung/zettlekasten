Simon, the person in the interview, re-engineer his learning. He uses tools to automate his learning 

Tools:
1. Zattlekasten, used to store more abstract knowledge he got from books, and other sources.
2. Anki, a flashcard, to help him remember **every now and then** the things that he has learnt
3. Readwise, to jot down highlights when he reads a book 

Periodically, he would go to Readwise, to go through his highlights and port them over to Anki as to make flashcards
